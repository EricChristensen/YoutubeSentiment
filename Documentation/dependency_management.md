# Dependency Managment
### The dependency management tool that we are using is virtualenv
### This basically creates a virtual environment in our project folder.
### This allows us to have an environment that is separate from anyone's own computer and files.
### To enter the virtual environment you will need to first install virtualenv https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/
### Then do "source YoutubeSentimentEnv/bin/activate"
### To add a dependency first install it with pip => "sudo pip install some_library"
### Then to add this dependency to the project so that everyone can use it and not just you, do "pip freeze > requirements.txt"
